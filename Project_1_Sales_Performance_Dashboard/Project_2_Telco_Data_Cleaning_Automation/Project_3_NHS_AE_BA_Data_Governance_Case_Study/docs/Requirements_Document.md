Requirements Document – NHS A&E Data Governance Case Study 
1. Project Overview

This case study focuses on improving data quality, governance, and reporting accuracy within the NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) department. The goal is to ensure that A&E data is clean, reliable, timely, and aligned with national NHS reporting standards.

2. Objectives

Improve accuracy of A&E activity data (arrivals, triage, waiting times, discharges).

Strengthen data governance practices to protect patient confidentiality and meet UK GDPR and Caldicott Principles.

Standardise data capture and reduce variation between clinical and administrative teams.

Produce clear, automated reporting for operational and performance teams.

3. Key Stakeholders

A&E Service Manager

Data & BI Team

Information Governance (IG) Lead

A&E Clinicians and Nurses

Performance & Reporting Team

IT and EHR System Support (e.g., EMIS/SystmOne/Cerner)

4. Current Problems (As-Is Issues)

Inconsistent recording of arrival time, triage category, and treatment start time.

Missing or duplicated patient records.

Manual workarounds leading to delays in reporting.

Poor traceability between clinical notes and administrative data.

Limited audit trails for data corrections.

5. High-Level Requirements (What the solution must achieve)
5.1 Data Quality Requirements

Standardised fields for A&E arrival, triage, treatment, and discharge.

Automated validation checks (e.g., no negative waiting times).

Removal of duplicate encounters.

Daily data-quality summary report.

5.2 Data Governance Requirements

Compliance with UK GDPR and Caldicott Principles.

Role-based access to patient-level data.

Secure audit logs for changes to A&E records.

Clear data retention and deletion rules.

5.3 Process Requirements

Defined workflow for data entry from arrival to discharge.

Clear accountability between clinical and administrative staff.

Documented escalation process for incorrect or missing data.

5.4 Reporting Requirements

Automated dashboard showing:

Attendances

Waiting times

Triage categories

Left Without Being Seen (LWBS)

Monthly performance report aligned to national NHS standards.

6. Success Criteria

95%+ completeness of required data fields.

100% compliance with Caldicott and UK GDPR for data handling.

Reduction in manual corrections by at least 30%.

Accurate daily/weekly/monthly performance reporting.

7. Out of Scope

Clinical decision-making or service redesign.

Changes to national A&E performance targets.

Development of new EHR systems (focus is on improving use of current system).

8. Assumptions

All users have access to the current EHR system.

Data definitions follow national A&E data dictionary standards.

IG approval is in place for data extraction and analysis.
