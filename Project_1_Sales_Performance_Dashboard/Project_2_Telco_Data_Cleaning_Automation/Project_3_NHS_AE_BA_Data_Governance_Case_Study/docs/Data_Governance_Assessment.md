Data Governance Assessment – NHS A&E Case Study 
1. Purpose of This Assessment
This document evaluates how A&E patient data is collected, stored, accessed, and reported. It identifies governance risks and recommends controls to ensure compliance with UK GDPR, Caldicott Principles, and NHS data-quality standards.

2. Data in Scope
•	Patient arrival and registration data
•	Triage category and clinical observations
•	Treatment timestamps
•	Discharge status
•	Staff notes and administrative updates
•	Extracted reporting data (daily/weekly/monthly)
________________________________________
3. Key Governance Risks
3.1 Data Quality Risks
•	Missing timestamps (arrival, triage, treatment start, discharge)
•	Incorrect sequencing (e.g., discharge time before treatment start)
•	Duplicate patient encounters
•	Inconsistent triage categories between staff
3.2 Data Security Risks
•	Unauthorised access to identifiable patient data
•	Inadequate audit trails
•	Screens visible to the public within the A&E environment
•	Data exports saved to unsecured locations
3.3 Data Privacy Risks
•	Over-collection of unnecessary personal data
•	Sharing patient data without a lawful basis
•	Lack of transparency in how data is used for reporting

4.2 Caldicott Principles
•	Justify the purpose for using patient information
•	Use the minimum necessary
•	Access only on a strict need-to-know basis
•	Ensure compliance and regular review

•	Timeliness
•	Accuracy
•	Completeness
•	Consistency
•	Validity

5. Recommended Controls
5.1 Data Entry Controls
•	Mandatory fields for arrival, triage, treatment start, discharge
•	Dropdown lists for categories to reduce free-text errors
•	Real-time validation rules (e.g., no negative waiting times)
5.2 Security Controls
•	Role-based access in the EHR system
•	Multi-factor authentication for admin/staff access
•	Enforced screen-lock timers
•	Secure storage for all exported files
5.3 Monitoring Controls
•	Weekly data-quality report
•	Monthly IG audit
•	Automated duplicate detection
•	Clear error-correction workflow

6. Improvement Recommendations
•	Provide regular staff training on data entry accuracy
•	Introduce a simple A&E data-quality dashboard
•	Align fields with national A&E Data Dictionary
•	Reduce manual data manipulation
•	Strengthen audit logs to track all changes
